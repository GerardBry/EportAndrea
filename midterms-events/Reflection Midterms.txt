Paglinang sa Filipino at Katutubong Wika: Makasaysayan sa Pagkakaisa ng Bansa
On August 22, 2025, our institution celebrated Buwan ng Wika with the theme “Paglinang sa Filipino at Katutubong Wika: Makasaysayan sa Pagkakaisa ng Bansa.” I enjoyed watching the performances, especially the songs, poems, and dances presented by different organizations, and I felt proud that our organization, the Solidarity of Integrated Governance of Mathematicians Association (SIGMA), placed second overall. I noticed how each group used tools such as digital slides, background music, and microphones to make their presentations clearer and more engaging. As a student, this made me more aware that careful planning, proper structure, and the smart use of available tools can turn simple ideas into meaningful presentations that communicate culture, identity, and unity in a more effective way.



Do-Day - September 3, 2025
On September 3, 2025, while our institution observed Do-Day, my research group and I were assigned to D.Q. Liwag National High School to administer our mathematics-related survey, strictly scheduled within the students’ Mathematics periods as required by the school. This arrangement prevented us from returning to Abaño Campus to join the clean-up, so before leaving, we prepared and left cleaning materials as our modest contribution to the activity. The experience made me reflect on how academic commitments and community initiatives can overlap, requiring careful judgment in how we allocate our time and effort.



Group Experiential Learning Task #1: Use of ICT and AI in the Classroom - September 10, 2025
Our first experiential learning task on September 10, 2025 involved creating and distributing a Google Forms survey to gather data on teachers’ use of ICT and AI in the classroom. I developed the survey form while my groupmates helped disseminate it to various teachers, allowing us to collect responses efficiently. The findings revealed that many educators, especially in rural areas, have limited familiarity with ICT tools, face challenges with insufficient technological resources, and some remain hesitant to use AI due to concerns about overdependence. This experience broadened my understanding of the existing digital gaps within the teaching community and the importance of providing proper support to ensure equitable access to technology. Communicating with my former high school teachers also reminded me how digital platforms strengthen professional connections and simplify collaboration, reinforcing the value of technology when used thoughtfully and responsibly.



Pasiklaban Intercollegiate Meet 2025 - September 15 - 19, 2025
The Pasiklaban Intercollegiate Meet 2025, held from September 15 to 19 in Camarines Norte State College, was a vibrant celebration of unity, talent, and school spirit as all nine departments—COED, CANR, COENG, CAS, COTT, CBPA, CFAST, CCMS, and Etienza—gathered to compete in a week-long showcase of skills. The opening day was filled with energy as each department proudly presented its flag, students wore their departmental shirts, and athletes paraded in their colorful uniforms to represent their academic homes. For the next several days, the competitions highlighted the dedication and discipline of the participants, and I genuinely enjoyed watching the events with my classmates as we supported our respective teams. The final day brought great pride to our department when the College of Education (COED) was declared the overall champion, a moment that strengthened my sense of belonging to the department. Reflecting on this experience, I realized that observing teamwork, strategy, and performance in a real-world setting deepened my understanding of how learning extends beyond the classroom: effective teaching, much like successful competitions, requires the thoughtful integration of content, learner needs, motivation, and supportive environment.



AI Activity - October 1, 2025
The AI Activity on October 1, 2025 introduced us to a range of modern digital tools that demonstrate how artificial intelligence can support students in completing academic tasks more efficiently and creatively. Sir Jake presented different AI platforms useful for designing presentations, enhancing images, developing e-portfolios, and producing other digital materials, all of which reflect the growing relevance of technology in the 21st-century learning environment. We explored Gemini, a powerful multimodal AI system capable of processing text, images, audio, video, and code, and I was able to generate sample AI-created photos during the session as you can see on the photos. We also discussed platforms such as Weebly, Wix, Canva, and MagicSchool, which offer accessible ways to design educational content and classroom materials. This experience made me appreciate how essential technological literacy has become for today’s learners, as these tools not only simplify complex tasks but also expand opportunities for creativity, problem-solving, and self-directed learning.



Teacher’s Day - October 2, 2025
The Teacher’s Day on October 2, 2025 was a simple yet meaningful celebration as our class surprised our adviser, Ma’am Analyn, to express our gratitude for her guidance and support. Sharing this moment with BSED Mathematics 3A reminded me of the positive impact that dedicated teachers have on our growth as students and future educators. The experience deepened my appreciation for the teaching profession and inspired me to carry the same passion, patience, and commitment in my own journey toward becoming a teacher.


Summative Test Examination- October 08, 2025
The Summative Test Examination held on October 8, 2025 served as a meaningful reminder of the value of consistent effort and responsible learning. Knowing that almost all pre-service teachers passed and that Ms. Faye B. Batoon earned the highest score inspired me to stay focused and disciplined in my studies. The careful validation of the test items also highlighted the importance of fairness and reliability in assessments, which is essential in the field of education. This experience encouraged me to evaluate my own progress, strengthen the areas I find challenging, and continue striving toward academic growth and professional excellence.



Midterm Test Examination - October 10, 2025
The Midterm Test Examination on October 10, 2025 made me reflect on my own progress and the effort I invested in preparing for it. Seeing the achievements of my classmates, especially the highest score earned by Ms. Janel Irish V. Pasatiempo, encouraged me to acknowledge both my strengths and the areas where I still need improvement. It reminded me that learning is a continuous process that requires focus, discipline, and consistency. This experience motivated me to push myself harder and aim for a higher score in the next examination. I realized that with better study habits, deeper understanding of the lessons, and a stronger commitment to my academic responsibilities, I can achieve better results. Moving forward, I am determined to improve, stay motivated, and strive for excellence in every assessment.

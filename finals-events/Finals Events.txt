United Nation Celebration - October 24, 2025

"Voices of Tomorrow: Empowering Communities for Global Change”
Attending the United Nations Day celebration on October 24, 2025 with the theme “Voices of Tomorrow: Empowering Communities for Global Change” made me reflect deeply on my responsibilities as a future educator. Seeing students use technology—such as digital presentations, background music, videos, and microphones—to share different cultures and global issues showed me how powerful these tools can be in giving learners a voice and helping them understand the world beyond the classroom. As a future teacher, I realized that Technology for Teaching and Learning 1 is not just about learning how to use tools, but about using them with purpose: to promote respect for diversity, encourage critical thinking, and inspire students to participate in solving real-life problems in their communities and in the world. The event reminded me that when I design future lessons and activities, I should use technology not only to make learning attractive, but also to guide my students to become compassionate, informed, and empowered members of a global society.



Mental Health Awareness Webinar - October 30, 2025
Everyday Actions, Stronger Minds
 "Little Things Matter: Everyday Actions for Mental Health”
By attending the “Everyday Actions, Stronger Minds” webinar with the theme "Little Things Matter: Everyday Actions for Mental Health”, made me realize that caring for mental health is not only about big decisions or formal counseling, but also about the small, consistent choices I make every day. I learned that simple actions like pausing to breathe, checking in on myself and others, setting healthy boundaries, and practicing gratitude can slowly build emotional strength and resilience. The insights shared by Ms. Marie Angelica C. Paz, RPsy, RGC (the resource speaker) helped me understand that it is okay to feel overwhelmed at times, as long as I respond with kindness instead of self-criticism. As a future educator, this reminded me that creating a supportive classroom does not always require grand programs—sometimes, listening, encouraging, and modeling healthy habits can already make a meaningful difference in my students’ well-being.



Dale's Cone of Experience Presentation - November 03, 2025
The Dale’s Cone of Experience presentation on November 3, 2025 was quite exhausting and rewarding, especially because only two of us worked on designing and constructing the cone, which truly tested our patience, creativity, and sense of responsibility. I initially felt stressed knowing that some groupmates could not help due to other academic tasks like research, but this was balanced when two of them volunteered to handle the presentation so they could still meaningfully contribute to the group. During the presentation, I appreciated how our group did not just describe Dale’s Cone of Experience but also corrected common misconceptions—such as the belief that it is a fixed hierarchy, a precise measure of retention, or a model that promotes passive learning. Instead, they clarified that the cone is only a visual guide that reminds teachers to provide varied, meaningful learning experiences, not a strict formula to follow. This experience strengthened my realization that, as a future educator, I should not be satisfied with appealing visual models alone but must critically examine the true intent behind educational theories and apply them wisely in planning learning activities that are suitable, engaging, and responsive to my students’ needs.



Research Title Defense - November 22, 2025
The Research Title Defense on November 22, 2025 marked the peak of a very demanding week, as we juggled multiple requirements while rushing to polish our research paper and finalize the concept of our Algebrazzle Quest Puzzle. With the help of technology—such as online collaboration platforms, shared documents, and digital presentation tools—our team was able to organize ideas more efficiently and transform our initial concept into a clearer, researchable study. During the defense, the panel’s questions and recommendations pushed me to think more deeply about how our research could truly address the needs of 21st-century learners, who learn best through interactive, engaging, and learner-centered approaches. When our research title was finally accepted, I felt a strong sense of fulfillment, not only because our hard work was recognized, but also because I realized that this process is training me to become a reflective future educator who uses research and technology to design learning experiences that genuinely support students’ growth.



Environmental Concern Advocacy Video - November 30, 2025
Filming our Environmental Concern Advocacy Video made me realize that environmental issues are deeply connected not only to ordinary citizens like us students, but also to the actions and accountability of those in government. Through the use of digital tools—such as video editing software, online platforms, and social media—we were able to transform our ideas into a powerful message that does not only highlight pollution and environmental degradation, but also calls attention to corruption and unfinished “ghost projects” that harm communities and misuse public resources. As a student, I understood that even small actions, like producing advocacy content, sharing information online, and encouraging others to be more critical and responsible, can contribute to raising awareness and promoting change. This experience strengthened my belief that 21st-century learners are not just passive recipients of information, but active creators of digital content who can use technology to speak up, influence others, and participate meaningfully in nation-building.



Week Talk (Deal or No Deal) - December 05, 2025
The Week Talk (Deal or No Deal) activity was a real emotional rollercoaster for me, especially because I only had about two days to prepare while also trying to finish several pending school requirements. Before my turn, I felt confident that I could answer whatever question I drew, since I had reviewed the lessons and trusted that I had something meaningful to say. However, the moment I was called, nerves started to take over—I suddenly worried that I might experience a mental block as soon as I saw the question. I chose briefcase number 20 because it is connected to my birthday, and the question I picked was: “Remember, it is not the technology tool, but it is the RIGHT BLEND of the THREE KNOWLEDGE AREAS.” I was able to answer, but I knew that Sir Jake was looking for a deeper explanation, especially in relation to TCK, PCK, and TPK, and my nervousness held me back from fully elaborating my ideas. This experience made me realize that knowing the content is not enough; I also need to manage my emotions, organize my thoughts clearly, and connect my answers more strongly to key concepts like the TPACK framework. As a future educator, I see this as a valuable lesson to be more prepared, to practice expressing my ideas confidently, and to treat every recitation not just as a requirement, but as training for the kind of presence and clarity I will need in my own classroom someday.
